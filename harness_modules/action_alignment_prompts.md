### Inferred Harness Specification & High-Value Research Prompts

To structurally deploy this specification in production-grade AI harnesses, we define three highly rigorous, non-obvious research prompts targeting representation alignment, cognitive architectures, and active learning:

#### Research Prompt 1: Mechanistic Lookback Circuit Alignment and Distillation
> **Domain:** Mechanistic Interpretability, Activation Engineering, and Model Compression.
>
> **Task:** Synthesize an automated training pipeline that performs **Circuit Distillation** to transfer the causal belief-tracking "lookback circuit" from an unaligned teacher model (e.g., Llama-3-70B-Instruct) into a smaller student model (e.g., Llama-3-8B), directly mitigating the thought-action gap.
>
> **Experimental Setup & Implementation:**
> 1.  **Circuit Mapping:** Write a PyTorch-based path-patching and activation-patching framework utilizing the `TransformerLens` library. Isolate the specific attention heads responsible for the *binding lookback* (co-locating character-object-state triples via Ordering IDs in low-rank subspaces) and the *answer lookback* (retrieving the state payload during query evaluation) in the teacher model.
> 2.  **Functional Mappings:** Calculate the functional importance of student attention heads. Identify "functionally correspondent" heads between the student and teacher models by minimizing the absolute difference in their performance degradation under mean ablation.
> 3.  **Representational Distillation:** Implement a training run where only the mapped student circuit heads are unfrozen. Formulate a composite objective function that combines a standard Cross-Entropy task loss ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$) with a Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) loss ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{CKA}}$) to structurally align corresponding activation matrices:
>
>     $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(y, \hat{y}_s) + \lambda \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}_{\text{paired}}} \left(1 - \text{CKA}\left(K_s^{(c)}, K_t^{(c)}\right)\right) \quad$$
>
> 4.  **Verification:** Evaluate the student model on sequential game-theoretic benchmarks (such as Rock, Paper, Scissors). Conduct test-time activation-patching on the student's distilled lookback circuit to verify whether the forced activation of these heads successfully steers the student model's final-token vocabulary distribution away from the default Nash prior and binds it causally to the optimal exploit-policy.

#### Research Prompt 2: Closed-Loop ReCAP with BDI Symbolic Logic Verification
> **Domain:** Cognitive Agent Architectures, Answer Set Programming (ASP), and Epistemic Governance.
>
> **Task:** Design and implement a closed-loop neuro-symbolic agent execution harness that wraps a frontier LLM (e.g., Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct) inside a formal Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) engine to eliminate "predictive-behavioral decoupling" in dynamic, resource-constrained environments.
>
> **Experimental Setup & Implementation:**
> 1.  **Dynamic Context Tree Management:** Build a Python execution harness that manages a dynamic context tree where each node is represented as a structured tuple: $\mathcal{N} = \langle \text{desc}, \text{subtask\_list}, \text{children\_list}, \text{obs\_list}, \text{think\_list} \rangle$. Implement the downward *plan-ahead decomposition* and upward *backtracking-driven refinement* loops.
> 2.  **Epistemic Scaffolding:** Wrap the LLM with strict XML/JSON syntactic fences to partition its in-context reasoning into distinct, unshared BDI blocks: `#Beliefs` (dynamic partner and environmental state predictions), `#Desires` (long-term utility constraints), and `#Intentions` (proposed tactical steps).
> 3.  **Symbolic Logic Loop:** Construct a non-LLM control layer in Python that continuously parses the LLM's `#Beliefs` and `#Intentions` into formal Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) propositions or Answer Set Programming (ASP) rules.
> 4.  **Metacognitive Guardrail:** Run the compiled propositions through a symbolic solver (e.g., Clingo) to check for logical consistency and goal alignment. If the proposed neural action ($a^i$) violates the optimal game-theoretic response to the predicted partner state ($\hat{a}^{-i}$)—such as failing to play "Paper" when predicting "Rock"—the symbolic supervisor must veto the token generation, inject an "Unresolved Confusion" indicator into the agent's memory, and trigger a recursive context-aware replanning loop (ReCAP) to rewrite the tactical intention. Compare the pass@1 success rate and loop-detection latency of this harness against standard sequential ReAct agents.

#### Research Prompt 3: Epistemic Sponge Mitigation via Active Bayes Risk Probing in POMDPs
> **Domain:** Post-Training RL Alignment, Robust Evaluation, and Active Learning.
>
> **Task:** Implement and evaluate an interactive reinforcement learning evaluation harness based on Sequential Inverse Plan Search (SIPS) to model the "expectation-realization gap" under high model-uncertainty and partial observability.
>
> **Experimental Setup & Implementation:**
> 1.  **POMDP Modeling:** Construct a formal Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model representing a cooperative human-robot gridworld task (such as Doors, Keys & Gems) with irreversible failure modes.
> 2.  **Active Learning Controller:** Write a Python module using PyTorch that calculates the immediate Bayes Risk ($BR$) associated with the agent's actions when transition, observation, and human reward models are uncertain:
>
>     $$BR(a) = \int_{\mathcal{M}} \left(Q^*_m(b_m, a) - Q^*_m(b_m, a^*_m)\right) p_{\mathcal{M}}(m) \, dm \quad$$
>
> 3.  **Meta-Query Execution:** Implement an active learning "meta-query" controller. When the calculated Bayes Risk of the least-risky action exceeds a defined cost threshold ($BR(a') > \xi$), the agent must halt autonomous execution and issue a programmatic, language-grounded "meta-query" to the human principal (e.g., "I am highly uncertain about your path; should I fetch Key 2 or Key 3?") to update its Dirichlet priors.
> 4.  **Verification:** Mathematically demonstrate how this active risk-minimization harness prevents the model's assumed partner rationality parameter ($\beta$) from collapsing under high model-uncertainty (mitigating the "epistemic sponge" effect), preserving high coordination efficiency and preventing catastrophic task failure.
